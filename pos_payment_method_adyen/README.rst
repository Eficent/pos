This module adds an integration between Odoo and Adyen payment terminals.

It is based on Odoo version 13 integration and has some added features such as
Passive and Active Shopper Recognition.

When the payment method is configured in the Point of Sale configuration the user
can send the amount of the order directly to the Adyen terminal and the capturing
of the money will be automatically done in Adyen.

Adyen Documentation: https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale
